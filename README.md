# Virtual Dice Roller

A simple JavaScript project that simulates a dice roll, displaying a random number between 1 and 6.

## Description

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a virtual dice roller. When the button is clicked, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated, and the corresponding dice image is displayed. The image is also rotated 90 degrees to give a sense of animation.

## Features

- Simulates a dice roll with a random number between 1 and 6.
- Displays the corresponding dice image.
- Rotates the image 90 degrees to give a sense of animation.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## Code Highlights

- Uses the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 6.
- Uses the `addEventListener()` method to attach a click event listener to the button.
- Uses the `style.transform` property to rotate the image 90 degrees.
- Uses the `src` attribute to change the image displayed.

## Example Use Case

This project can be used as a starting point for more complex games or simulations that involve random number generation. It can also be used to create interactive and engaging experiences for users.

## Note

The project uses external image files, which are linked to in the JavaScript code. Make sure to update the image URLs if you plan to use this project in a different environment.
